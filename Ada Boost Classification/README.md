# Ada Boost Classifier from Scratch

trX.mat contains a matrix of size 2 X 160. Each of the column vectors holds "loudness" and
"noisiness" features that describe a song. If the song is louder and noisier, it belongs to the
"metal" class, and vice versa. trY.mat holds the labeling information of the songs: -1 for
"rock", +1 for "metal".
