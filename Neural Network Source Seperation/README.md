# Neural Network from Scratch (Source Seperation)

- trs.wav and trn.wav are train clean signal and noise
- tex.wav and tes.wav are test mixture signal and clean signal
- Y is the binary mask and X is input mixture signal


Neural Network is trained with one hidden unit with activation function taken as Relu for hidden unit and Sigmoid for output unit.


## Parameters used
- learning rate = 0.00001
- Hidden layer activation is Relu
- Output layer activation is Sigmoid
- Epochs =  10000


## Output 

SNR ratio of clean signal vs predicted clean signal is 6.46
